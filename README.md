# Zway-ForecastIO

Zway Automation module for fetching current condition and forecasts from the
ForecastIO API. Creates virtual devices for humidity, wind, current 
conditions and forecasts.

See https://developer.forecast.io/ for details.

# Configuration

## latitude, longitude

Location for weather forecast

## unitTemperature

Display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit

## unitSystem

Display metric or imperial units for air pressure and wind speed

## apiKey

Required API key for accessing the service. See 
https://developer.forecast.io/register for obtaining an API key.

## windDevice, humidityDevice, barometerDevice

Flag that sets if devices should be created

# Virtual Devices

This module creates up to five virtual devices

## Current conditions

Displays the current condition as an icon and the current temperature. 
Additionally the following metrics are set

*    metrics:level Current temperature
*    metrics:temperature
*    metrics:condition
*    metrics:conditiongroup: fair,neutral,poor or snow
*    metrics:feelslike: Felt temperature
*    metrics:ozone: Ozone level
*    metrics:dewpoint: Dewpoint temperature
*    metrics:cloudcover: Cloud cover [0-100]
*    metrics:weather: Current weather summary (only in English) 
*    metrics:pop: probability of precipitation [0-100]
*    metrics:high: expected high temperature today
*    metrics:low: expected low temperature today
*    metrics:percipintensity: Rain intensity in mm or inches / 1h
*    metrics:raw: raw current conditions data returned by the API

## Forecast

Displays the forecasted condition as an icon, and the expected temperature 
range.

*    metrics:level Forecast temperature range
*    metrics:condition
*    metrics:conditiongroup: fair,neutral,poor or snow
*    metrics:weather: Forecast summary (only in English)
*    metrics:pop: probability of precipitation
*    metrics:percipintensity: intensity of percipitation
*    metrics:high: expected high temperature today
*    metrics:low: expected low temperature today
*    metrics:raw_daily: raw daily forecast data returned by the API
*    metrics:raw_hourly: raw hourly forecast data

## Wind

Displays the current wind speed. Wind strength is indicated by the icon.

*    metrics:level: Wind speed
*    metrics:dir: Wind direction
*    metrics:wind_avg: Wind average of last three updates
*    metrics:winddregrees: Wind degrees
*    metrics:beaufort: Wind strength in beaufort [0-12]

## Humidity

Displays the current humidity.

## Barometer

Displays the current air pressure.

## Cloudcover

Displays the current cloudcover.

# Events

No events are emitted

# Installation

The prefered way of installing this module is via the "Zwave.me App Store"
available in 2.2.0 and higher. For stable module releases no access token is 
required. If you want to test the latest pre-releases use 'k1_beta' as 
app store access token.

For developers and users of older Zway versions installation via git is 
recommended.

```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules
git clone https://github.com/maros/Zway-ForecastIO.git ForecastIO --branch latest
```

To update or install a specific version
```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/ForecastIO
git fetch --tags
# For latest released version
git checkout tags/latest
# For a specific version
git checkout tags/1.02
# For development version
git checkout -b master --track origin/master
```
